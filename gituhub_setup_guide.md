# Now how to do the git!
- `git init` initialises new repo on localhost
- `git status` to check what was added to be sent to GitHub
- `git add` adds all files/folders from the current location
- `git commit -m "first commit"` -m is to put any logical message
- `git branch -M main` To change branch from `master` to `main`
- `git remote add origin git@github.com:[user]/[repo].git` # connects localhost to GitHub repo
- `git push -u origin main` pushes the code upstream from localhost to GitHub
